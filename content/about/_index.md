**TL:DR** - I'm an app developer, a father, and a husband.

You will find some of my work on [GitHub](http://github.com/johanwigmo), and you can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://se.linkedin.com/in/johanwigmo).  

You can read a [short form resume](/about/online-resume) or download a more extensive [resume as a PDF](/about/johanwigmo-resume_2511.pdf).

## What is this

I've been working as an app developer for over a decade. My focus has and will always be on iOS, but in recent years I've expanded my skills to include Android. 

I enjoy learning new things and I've found that one of the best ways to learn is trying to teach someone else. This website is my digital notepad where I can document ideas, share learnings, and reflect on projects - and others things. 

I could keep this all to myself, but publish it to the _public_ will make me think it through both once and twice. Repeating and learning. And hopefully, someone else will also learn something.

## Who I Am

I'm a husband and a father of two, living in a cosy area outside Gothenburg, Sweden. I've been an employed consultant for 10+ years but since the end of 2025 I work for myself with [Wigmo Development](https://wigmo.dev), doing consulting work during the days and working on my own projects during the nights. Balancing family, work and personal growth keeps me busy, but it's a challenge I enjoy. 

For fun, I love listening to music, taking time to zone out and recharge, or heading outdoors for a round of disc golf or a bike ride.
